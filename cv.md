## Research Interests
I am interested in cyber physical system (CPS) controller synthesis, and more generally, in formal methods.

## Research

#### Logical Systems Lab
<p class="rightDate">2020-present</p>
- Designed and formally verified a train control system for the full US Federal Railway
Authority physics model in collaboration with Siemens. (Paper)[assets/train-control-emsoft-preprint.pdf] accepted to EMSOFT 2022.
- Creating a framework to deductively synthesize formally verified controllers given a
specification of the environment, safety contract, and possible action space of a cyber physical system.
- Designed an algorithm to automatically generate symbolic bounds on differential
inequalities, with application in CPS controller verification
and synthesis.

#### Capra, Cornell University
<p class="rightDate">2018-2020</p>
As an undergraduate at Cornell, I was a part of [Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/), where I contributed to [Gator](/assets/gator-oopsla2020-preprint.pdf), a DSL for geometry types, and on [an algorithm](/assets/commutativity-tapas2020-preprint.pdf) to efficiently verify the commutativity of diagrams such as those representing the transformation between types.

#### McMahon Lab, Cornell University
<p class="rightDate">2019</p>
At the [McMahon Lab](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/), I worked on understanding the scope and applications of Gaussian Boson Sampling.

#### CLASSE, Cornell University 
<p class="rightDate">2016, 2017</p>
Worked on a project to detect dark photons generated by positron-electron annihilation.
