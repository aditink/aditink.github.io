## Research Interests
I am interested in cyber physical system (CPS) controller synthesis, and more generally, in formal methods.

## Research

#### Logical Systems Lab
<p class="rightDate">2020-present</p>
- Designed and formally verified a train control system for the full US Federal Railway
Authority physics model in collaboration with Siemens. Paper accepted to EMSOFT 2022.
- Creating a framework to deductively synthesize formally verified controllers given a
specification of the environment, safety contract, and possible action space of a cyber physical system. Proof search is to be done by an AlphaZero-like agent in differential dynamic logic.
- Designed an algorithm to automatically generate symbolic bounds on differential
equations along with a proof certificate, with application in CPS controller verification
and synthesis.

#### Capra, Cornell University
<p class="rightDate">2018-2020</p>
Worked on Gator, a DSL for geometry types, and on verifying if graphs, such as those modeling implicit type conversion in scala, commute.

#### McMahon Lab, Cornell University
<p class="rightDate">2019</p>
Worked on identifying the applications and limitations of Gaussian Boson Sampling, a near term optical quantum computing device.

#### CLASSE, Cornell University 
<p class="rightDate">2016, 2017</p>
Worked on a project to detect dark photons generated by positron-electron annihilation.
