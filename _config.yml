# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a third year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Andr√© Platzer at the <a href="https://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/">Logical Systems Lab</a>.
  I am interested in the synthesis of controllers for cyber physical systems, and more generally in formal methods.
  I'm excited about scaling verified controller design to handle greater complexity and require lower manual effort.
  I have worked on <a href="assets/train-control-emsoft-preprint.pdf">formally verified train control</a>.<br>
  Previously, I was software engineer at Microsoft, and worked in the Azure reserved instances team.
  As an undergraduate at Cornell, I was a part of <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/">Capra</a>, where I contributed to Gator, a domain specific programming language for geometry types, and worked on an algorithm to efficiently verify the commutativity of diagrams such as those representing the transformation between types.
  I also worked on understanding the scope and applications of Gaussian Boson Sampling at the <a href="https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/">McMahon Lab</a>.
