SafeRails is a startup that aims to bring train software increased reliability and maintainability by leveraging formal methods techniques.

Our MVP is a verified train protection system.
Train protection systems safeguard railroad operations by keeping motion within a safe envelope.
These systems decide when to slow trains down to avoid collisions with other trains, stay inside movement authorities, and navigate slopes, curves, and tunnels safely.
SafeRails aims to create a train protection system with increased safety and reliability by creating control software that is mathematically proven safe, with the proof of safety checked by a computer.

This (post)[https://aditink.github.io/draft/2023/06/27/verified-train-control.html] provides general audience explanation of the underlying research which is also published as a (journal paper)[https://aditink.github.io/assets/train-control-emsoft-preprint.pdf].
As a (Swartz Innovation Commercialization Fellow)[https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/education-and-resources/innovation-fellows/current-fellows.html], I am working towards commercialize my research with the support of (Project Olympus)[https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/education-and-resources/project-olympus/].
